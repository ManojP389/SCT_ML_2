#  Customer Grouping using K-Means Clustering

This machine learning project uses the **K-Means clustering** algorithm to group customers into different groups based on their annual income and spending score. The goal is to understand customer behavior patterns and assist in targeted marketing.

##  Project Overview

- **Algorithm**: K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
- **Dataset**: Mall Customer Dataset (includes Age, Annual Income, Spending Score, etc.)
- **Goal**: Group similar customers based on features for business insights

##  Features Used

- Age  
- Annual Income  
- Spending Score  

##  Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Dataset loaded and basic analysis done.
2. **Feature Selection**: Chosen key features for clustering.
3. **Finding Optimal Clusters**: Used Elbow Method to determine best number of clusters (WSS plot).
4. **Model Building**: Applied K-Means Clustering.
5. **Visualization**: Plotted clusters to understand segmentation.

##  Elbow Method Result

- WSS plot helped determine the ideal number of clusters (e.g., 5).

##  Output Example

- 5 distinct customer groups visualized on a 2D scatter plot based on income vs. spending.

##  Tools Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
